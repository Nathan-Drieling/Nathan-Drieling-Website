                    My college academics began with two years at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College. 
                    From the fall of 2012 to the fall of 2014, I went to both the Harrison County and the Jackson County Campuses. 
                    While attending, I persued (but did not attain) a Bachelor of Science.

                    In the spring of 2015, I transfered to the University of Southern Mississippi 
                    and switched my major to Computer Science where 
                    I graduated with a <strong>3.0 GPA</strong> average in the spring of 2019.
                    Here, I learned various programming langauges and technologies and had many great instructors. 
                    I enjoyed all my coursework of which were <em>Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, 
                    Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Database Management Systems, Operating Systems, 
                    Theory of Programming Languages and Algorithms, Software Engineering I and Software Engineering II</em>. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I used the <strong>C++</strong> programming language for most of my main core courses. 
                    However, I also used <strong>Java</strong> for other courses, <strong>MySQL and SQL</strong> for my Database Management Systems class, 
                    and even tinkered with some of the <strong>Python</strong> programming language for my Theory of Programming Languages class. I also was 
                    exposed to using <strong>Agile Software Development</strong> from my Software Engineering I and Software Engineering II Capstone classes.

                    Overall, my undergraduate years at USM was very personally fullilling. 
                    I developed a great desire to make software products that could be used to 
                    help my community and to serve my country in my own unique way.

                    In the summer of 2018, while still at USM, I had the unique opprotunity to do a three month internship at
                    <strong>NASA John C. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi</strong> as a result of an instructors recommendation.
                    The internship project 
                    
                    specifically dealt with helping the National Data Buoy Center
                    and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's main operations for gathering weather data 
                    for the public use. Here, I gained my first real world software development experience and what it would be like 
                    to work in the industry
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    by creating a database back end
                    using MariaDB and testing it using the Eclipse IDE for the Java Programming language.
                    In addition, I also created supporting charts and graphs of bouy coordinates using MATLAB.
                    <br>

                    <img src = "NOAA.png" alt = "NASA" class = "AboutMePictures"/>
                    In my last week, I gave a presentation in front of the NDBC staff where I demonstrated some of the database functionalities 
                    along with all supporting front end test code and any other graphs, or charts which I had produced.

                    In November of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                    I managed to secure a fully remote (and then hybrid) full time software development position in Metairie, Louisiana, 
                    with a federal government contracting company based in Juneau, Alaska called Goldbelt Inc. 
                    While employed with Goldbelt (and its subsidiary - Goldbelt Nighthawk), I worked on a personell management software 
                    called My Navy Assignment- as part of a continuing contract for the United States Navy.
