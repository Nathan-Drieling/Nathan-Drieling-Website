                    February 1st, 2025: The Artifical Intelligence Race Between the USA and China
                </h3>
                <hr>

                <!-- Blog Entry here... -->

                <p>New York Times Bestselling author 
                    Kai-Fu Lee's book, 
                    <em>
                        "AI Superpowers: China, 
                        Silicon Valley, 
                        And The New World Order"
                    </em>
                    Warned of the eventual AI race 
                    between the major hedgemonic powers
                    of the United States and China. Written in 
                    2018, it was far ahead in its predictions
                    for how the world would function and how
                    society would adapt in the eventual rise of
                    advanced intelligent systems. He describes
                    how even chess grandmasters couldn't compete 
                    with machines considering every possible
                    move and counter-move available and how few
                    could match an intelligent machines ability to
                    algorithmically predict each move that its
                    opponent would make. And his book was only written
                    in 2018, leaving only to wonder if he had written a
                    sequel could he describe the advances being made.
