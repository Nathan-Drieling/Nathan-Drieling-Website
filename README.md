My personal website which uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. I will add more functionalities as the project progresses. This is a solo project.

  1. index.html          - This is the main html file showing the front page of the website
  2. about.html          - This contains the about section of my website. (This section is more or less complete but may add more in the future)
  3. portfolio.html      - This contains my current projects or projects I've done in University. 
  4. services.html       - This will show what services I can offer an employer and what seperate technologies I know.
  5. contact.html        - This will contain my contact info from GitHub, StackOverflow and my LinkedIn. (Trying to get the email system to work in future update.)
  6. stylesheet.css      - This is the main css code for website
  7. particles.min.js    - This is an open source javascript package that creates the particle effects on website.
